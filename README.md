# B-PlusTree
Basic implementation of a B+ Tree in C++  

This code implements a memory resident B+ Tree that supports duplicate keys.  
(Implemented as a part of an assignment at UFL, Gainesville)  

Implemented methods:  
	- Insert(key,value): Inserts a give key, value pair into the tree  
	- Initialize(m): Initializes a tree with given order (supported values > 2)  
	- Search(key): Returns a vector of values for the given key. Empty vector if the key is 
	not present in the tree.  
	- Search(key1, key2): Returns a vector of values for the given key range (key>=key1 && key<=key2). 
	Empty vector if the key is not present in the tree.
